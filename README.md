Some sort of tutorial
====

Each subfolder has its own readme, so you should be able to look at it pretty easily in github.

You'll be using a text editor for this. I use sublime (http://www.sublimetext.com/), but atom (https://atom.io/) is also good. There's a lot of choices, but TextEdit isn't great for it.

This is not supposed to teach you everything. You should research everything presented here, find out lots of things about everything. Programming is mostly understanding some core concepts and using google really well.
